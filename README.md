Repo for code relating to playing with Google ADK. [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/google-adk/), [ADK github](https://github.com/google/adk-python/), [ADK docs](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/))

The docs and samples available are not great so I'm creating working 
examples of everything along with information on how to get them working.

I'm hoping to turn these into a series of articles. I'm probably at that point now I've got a 
lot of samples.
